As we move forward we will be editing your server files. You will need to restart the server each time. 
You can kill the server by typing Ctrl + C in your Terminal. But I suggest using a “watcher” that will do this for you.

use Nodemon tool. You can install it globally with this command:

npm install -g nodemon

nodemon server.js
